				<p>We are thrilled you will join us for our wedding celebration in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil! This document provides helpful information for our first-time visitors from Europe, offering guidance on travel logistics and cultural expectations.</p>
				<p>


					<span style="font-weight: bold;">When:</span> The wedding is on Saturday, May 10th. From Friday to Sunday, we have the location and will provide a program.</p>
					<p>

						<span style="font-weight: bold;">Where:</span> The exact location of our wedding is the private beach called Praia da Jaca (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/MStwwKrFyG7kLo2Y9">Google Maps</a>) in the city of Angra dos Reis, which is three hours from Rio de Janeiro. It is located in the Frade condominium, where we rented two beach houses.</p>

								<ul>



									<li>
										<span style="font-weight: bold;">Passport:</span> Please make sure your passport is up to date and not close to expiring.</li>

										<li>
											<span style="font-weight: bold;">Yellow fever vaccine:</span> Easy to get at your local pharmacy and a good precaution, though the risk is considered low in Rio state.</li>
											<li>

												<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dengue vaccine:</span> Cases of dengue have increased in recent years. A new dengue vaccine is available. Neither Camila nor Johannes are currently vaccinated, but they are considering it.</li>

											<button class="collapsible">Things to consider for your travels in Brazil</button>
											<div class="content">
												<ul>

													<li>
														<span style="font-weight: bold;">Currency & Money:</span> The Brazilian currency is called the Real (plural: Reais). You do not need to withdraw any cash; we recommend using credit cards or phone payments. In Brazil, you can pay for almost anything directly by card, even a coconut on the beach.


.</li>


														<li>

															<span style="font-weight: bold;">Only a small percentage speaks English:</span> 
															Brazilian Portuguese is a Latin language and very close to Spanish, Italian, and French. If you speak any of those languages, you should be able to navigate Brazil very easily. However, if you only rely on English, try to do you research upfront and do not rely on other people pointing you in the right direction.

														</li>
														<li>

															<span style="font-weight: bold;">Safety and security:</span> The answer depends on what you want to experience. In Brazil there is a massive gap between the rich and the poor. Most people struggle to live a life regarding the most basic needs. Therefore, you should watch out for expensive jewelry and phones when you are not in a wealthy city area.
															<ul>
																<li>Sao Paulo is the commercial and financial center of Brazil. The closer you get to the city center, the more expensive and rich it becomes. You find the most expensive restaurants and the most exclusive shopping centers. In those parts of the city, there is a different level of police presence and protection. On the other hand, the closer you get to the old downtown SP or the city's outskirts, you have to be careful when walking the streets. Here it's recommended to travel with Uber from place to place and not take out your phone in public.</li>
																<li>Rio de Janeiro is the most famous tourist destination of Brazil. There are more pickpockets, and the Favelas (Ghettos) are spread throughout the city. You can walk from a safe neighborhood straight into a Favela without much of a transition. This can be dangerous, and you should try to stay out of the Favelas.</li>
																<li>In general, try to not walk home when it's dark. Do not wave around your phone in public. And try to stay out of dangerous neighborhoods.</li>

															</ul>
														</li>

													<button class="collapsible">Travel Recommendation for Brazil</button>
													<div class="content">
														<p><b>One week (example 4th to 11th of May): Rio & Angra dos Reis:</b> If you consider staying for one week, we recommend the following travel agenda:</p>

														<ul>
															<li>Arrive on Sunday, May 4th, in Rio de Janeiro, where you should stay until Thursday, May 8th, to explore the most popular travel destination in Brazil. We recommend Rio as you will have an easier time with the language since it is more touristic, and there are many things to do, such as visiting the Christ the Redeemer statue, taking the gondola up Sugarloaf Mountain, and strolling at Copacabana Beach.</li>
															<li>On Friday, travel to Praia da Jaca by Uber or rental car and then return after the wedding to Rio to fly out again.</li>
														</ul>

														<p><b>Two weeks (example 4th to 18th of May): Rio to Sao Paulo coastline Roadtrip:</b> This agenda is for people who want to travel alone by car and remain flexible in their plans. The coastline between Rio and São Paulo is well developed. We have done similar trips multiple times. Many places along the coast are worth visiting. The agenda outline is the same as above. We recommend renting a car. Start in Rio and plan multiple stops along the coast. For example, you could do the following:</p>
														<ul>
															<li>After the wedding, drive down to Paraty, an old town with beautiful scenery. We have visited Paraty twice (<a href="https://johannesklumpe.com/i-love-paraty-rj/">previous visit</a>), and it's an amazing place. Stay there for three days to explore the many attractions: visit a cachaça distillery, take a boat tour to nearby islands, explore the historic city center, and hike to a waterfall. Paraty is very touristic, so you will find many English speakers.</li>
															<li>Along the coastline, consider other stops such as Ubatuba, a famous surf and beach town. For a more developed destination, drive to Riviera de São Lourenço. Also, visit the island of Ilhabela, a beautiful place, but pack mosquito repellent.</li>
														</ul>


														<p>When you consider staying longer in Brazil, these are places we recommend visiting:
															<ul>
																<li>Visit Rio de Janeiro: Stay at Copacabana and explore the vibrant city.</li>
																<li>Visit São Paulo: Experience the bustling metropolis with its diverse culture.</li>
																<li>Rent a car and drive along the coastline between Rio and São Paulo: Visit multiple stunning beaches.</li>
																<li>Visit Fortaleza: Enjoy the beautiful beaches and lively atmosphere.</li>
																<li>Visit Lençóis Maranhenses: Travel to São Luís and drive to Barreirinhas to see the unique sand dunes and lagoons.</li>
																<li>Visit Iguazu Falls: Marvel at the breathtaking waterfalls on the border with Argentina.</li>
															</ul>
